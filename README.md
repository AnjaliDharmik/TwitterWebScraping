# TwitterWebScraping
Scrape Data from Twitter Using Python without login or create Twitter Account with your credential 
Twitter Scraping Introduction:
Now a days, most people and organization sharing their views and comments on twitter, which is related to product, services and pricing.
By the Web Scraping we can collect Twitter data. You don’t need to create or login with your credentials. Twitter provides limited twits length (140 characters, that has now increased to 280). 

We are using python programming language with selenium and BeautifulSoup libraries to collect the data from twitter.

Twitter has around 350 million monthly active users, and the count keeps growing. What is more important is that all the influential people, brands, and companies are on Twitter, voicing their opinion on everyday topics. And these opinions and comments matter. Twitter can help you do a low cost and effective market study.

Analysing tweets from a disaster-hit area might help the government and rescue teams to evacuate or send help to people more easily. I have worked on a project where I extracted post, images and videos tweeted and applied sentiment analysis to identify -ve twits. These texts had information that if made public, immediately when tweeted, could have benefited many. The possibilities of what you can do with Twitter data feed is limitless.
